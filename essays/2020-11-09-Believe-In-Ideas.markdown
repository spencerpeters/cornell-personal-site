title: Believe in Ideas

Whenever I have a great idea, I’m passionate about getting the word out and making it happen. 

As an undergraduate at the University of Washington, I realized that our physics department (one of the largest in the country) lacked opportunities for students to socialize and network. So I joined the Society of Physics Students and started a newsletter to promote new weekly social events, which eventually had 300+ subscribers. Among other events, I organized our Zone Meeting, a Thanksgiving food drive culminating in a professor pie-ing, and a trip to the 2016 SPS Quadrennial Congress in San Francisco. My efforts were recognized by a SPS Leadership Award in 2017, one of ten awarded that year nationwide.

Another example comes from my internship in summer 2018 at Microsoft Research (Quantum Architectures and Computation group), where I was tasked with building numerical physics solvers. While coding the new solvers, I discovered that there was no high-level architecture for chaining simulation tasks together. So I designed a framework for chaining simulation tasks, handling data transfer, and automating deployment, and pitched it to my mentor. During a week-long coding sprint, my colleague and I helped the device modeling group integrate existing simulation tasks with the new framework, which became a permanent part of the team’s infrastructure.

These experiences remind me to believe in ideas. Social events for physics students? A framework for simulation jobs? Nobody but me believed in these ideas, until I made them happen, and showed everyone how much they were needed.
